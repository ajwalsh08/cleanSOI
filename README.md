These files will help you analyze the IRS' migration data for your own county using R.

The first step is downloading R, which is available <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">here.</a>

Then download this repository to your computer (use the "Download ZIP" option).

Open the folder, and then open the file called "migration.R". This should open in a separate window in R. 

Once you've got the code open in R, select all of it, paste it into the R Console, and run it. You've now loaded the function into R! You're a computing genius!

Now you should be able to run the function like so:

+ migration("Jefferson", "AL")

Doing so will generate a new spreadsheet (.csv) in the folder you downloaded with the R code in it. It should be pretty easy to spot!

If you have questions about the output, tweet me, at @ajwalsh08. Have fun!
